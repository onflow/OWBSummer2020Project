## Detailed Review

A game in which you build up your base from whatever you can find in a post apocalyptic world
of the future. You do that with the hope of restarting the civilization but more urgently to
prepare for the nightshade attacks.

Game involves various kinds of NFTs representing items and resources obtained by scavaning or crafting activities. Scavenging is a time-gated RPG boss loot drop without the boss killing part, while crafting involves obtaining a combination of resources defined in a recipe which can
be transformed into a new resource, destroying some or all of the ingredients in the process.

The blockchain part will be geared heavily towards multiplayer cooperation and to lesser extent
competition, with better and more rewards for coop activities and a notification system
whenever coop opportunities should arise.

The game will be extended with non blockchain subgames like arcade platform-shooter
for the scavenging part and a tower defense on top of the base.

## Limitations and Plans
It is a very early stage with many of the core features not developed or being in a PoC level,
most notably there is nothing close to a Game UI. The Cadence part, with NFT minting (by both scavenge and crafting) in particular, is in the best developed element.
Yet the cooperative element, including but not limited to the marketplace is to be designed and developed.
Also the initial set of "Forms", "Combinations" need to be designed.

There are unrealized features of friendship tokens, guilds, and investor stake in scavenging rewards
Onboarding strategy to be implemented.
